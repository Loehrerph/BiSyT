This repository contains the auxiliary scripts used to perform the analyses for our manuscript 'Increased prefrontal top-down control in older adults predicts motor performance and age-group association'. We used the commercial software packages BESA research 6.0, BESA statistics 1.0, and SPSS 22.0 for preprocessing and statistical analysis of EEG/ERP data,as well as beahvioural data. Further EEG data analysis was carried out employing SPM 12 for MATLAB. Here, source reconstruction and GCM specification were done using the GUI. Summarizing, findings central to this manuscript were obtained using the software packages BESA, SPSS, and SPM 12. Auxiliary custom made scripts and code were developed in MATLAB and are available here. Further details regarding code and data analysis are found in the manuscript under Code availability and Methods sections.
